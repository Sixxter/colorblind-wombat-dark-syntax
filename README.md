# Colorblind Wombat Dark Syntax theme

This theme was created for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) in an attempt to allow colorblind people to differentiate the text easily.

## Customized languages
* __css__
* __javascript__
* __json__
* __markdown__
* __php__
* __python__

While it should work with any language that Atom supports, languages that I don't use haven't been tested yet.

## Motivation
I, like millions of other people suffer from colorblindness. I wanted a theme that was comfortable to my eyes, let me distinguish as many colors as possible, and wouldn't bother people that can see colors.

I couldn't find a theme that was just right, so I began experimenting with changing preexisting themes. When I found a theme that I liked and was really close to working for me, I forked the theme and heavily modified it to cater to colorblind issues.

## Colorblind Wombat Dark Syntax theme creation
The closest theme that I found that would work for my eyes was the [Wombat Dark Syntax](https://atom.io/themes/wombat-dark-syntax) theme. The files used to create the Wombat Dark Syntax theme were already wonderfully customized to the languages that I wanted to use. There were a few things that I didn't like about the theme, but the structure was there to make the creation of my own theme easy.

Colorblind Wombat Dark Syntax theme is created from Wombat Dark Syntax theme combined with the default generic syntax theme and an extended [conservative 7-color palettes for color blindness](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/colorblind/) that attempts to use colors that are viewable by anyone regardless of color vision. While I had to use more colors that available in the 7-color palette, I hope that the additions will work for all types of colorblindness.
